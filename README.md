## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Render.com. To deploy:

1. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com)
2. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
3. In Render:
   - Create a new Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use the following settings:
     - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - Start Command: `gunicorn project4.wsgi:application`

4. Add the following environment variables in Render:
   - `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Automatically generated by Render for production
   - `DEBUG`: false
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: your-app.onrender.com

> **Security Note**: The Django secret key is handled differently in development and production:
> - In development: A default key is used (safe for local testing only)
> - In production: Render automatically generates a secure key through the `generateValue` setting
> Never commit sensitive keys to version control.

The deployment will be handled automatically through GitHub Actions whenever you push to the main branch.
